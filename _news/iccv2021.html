I'll be giving an invited talk on "Learning to Infer and Generate Programs for 3D Shapes and Scenes" at two ICCV workshops: <a href="https://holistic-3d.github.io/iccv21/">Holistic Structures for 3D Vision</a> and <a href="https://geometry.stanford.edu/struco3d/">Structural and Compositional Learning on 3D Data</a>.
