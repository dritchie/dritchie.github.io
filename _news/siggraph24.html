I'll be at SIGGRAPH 2024. I'll be running a <a target="_blank" href="https://s2024.conference-program.org/presentation/?id=bof_111&sess=sess243">BoF on PhD student mentoring</a> (submit topics for discussion <a target="_blank" href="https://forms.gle/wA3pxH3mzAfUGThE9">here</a>) and helping out with the <a tareget="_blank" href="https://s2024.conference-program.org/presentation/?id=villip_101&sess=sess215">thesis fast forward</a>. Oh, and if you have a paper that features a creative use of the SIGGRAPH logo, don't forget to submit to the <a target="_blank" href="http://siggraph-logo.gallery/">SIGGRAPH Logo Gallery</a>. See you in Denver!
