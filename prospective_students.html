<h2>Information for Prospective Students</h2>
<hr/>

<p>
	I am actively seeking graduate and undergraduate students to work with me on research projects. This document will give you a sense for what I am looking for in a student, and what the next steps to take are. Please read it in its entirety before contacting me to ask about doing research.
</p>

<h3>Current Brown Students</h3>

<p>
	Please consult the <a target='_blank' href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/11U2aisteeSSU8Ds-d-R81dBUKN-VnBgX5W1ZHqG_IsA/edit?usp=sharing'>Brown Visual Computing Onboarding Guide</a>.
</p>


<h3>Prospective Students</h3>

<p>
	If you're not (yet) at Brown and are interested in working with me, you may feel the urge to send me email introducing yourself and/or inquiring after a research position. 
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Don't.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	If you have a specific question about my research (e.g. you're working on a project related to one of my papers and need to ask for clarification about something), I'm happy to engage with you. But if your message is an inquiry about whether I'm accepting new students, a request for a research position, or anything of the sort, I will not reply. Instead, you should consult the following:
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Prospective undergraduate students:</strong> I don't have any say in undergraduate admissions. Please apply directly to the University. If you're admitted, then you can approach me about potential research projects.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Prospective Masters students:</strong> I don't have any say in Masters admissions. Please apply directly to the CS department. If you're admitted, then you can approach me about potential research projects.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Prospective PhD students:</strong> Please apply directly to the CS department's PhD program. In the application form, there is a place to mention faculty you are interested in working with. Putting my name here guarantees that I will be one of the people who looks at your application.
	
	<!-- <a target='_blank' href='http://cs.brown.edu/degrees/doctoral/'>Brown Computer Science Department's PhD program</a>. If you have specific questions about the work I do and whether you’d be a good fit (that aren’t answered by this document), you’re welcome to email me. <i>I will not respond to generic emails asking for a research position/internship</i>. -->
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Prospective "interns":</strong> <i>I do not respond to emails asking for a research "internship" / summer position from students outside of Brown.</i>
